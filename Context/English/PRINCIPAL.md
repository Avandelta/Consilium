# Documentation Logic.

## Chapter I: Documentation Basis.

This documentation explains how it works and the relationship between all project documentation. This is a secondary document that will not be listed on the project site or on the server. It does not have direct administrative power on the project server, but it is an excellent explanation to any project user how the administrative side of servers works.

## Chapter II: Documentation Direction.

The basic rules of the project (hereinafter referred to as the "Constitution") prescribe the initial rights of the project participants and the administration. The "Constitution" introduces a systematic definition of administration posts, introduces restrictions and terms of voting and their terms. It is the original document, edited only by the developers.

The rules continue the terminology of the "Constitution" and introduce legal restrictions and terminology. They spell out not only the rules for the game area of ​​the project, but also for the general one, including the system department and the introduction of the concept of "autonomy of project servers". Rules can also be edited by verifiers (when certain conditions are met), developers or managers of this server. The rules are governed by the "Constitution" and are at a lower administrative level.

The charter reinforces the terminology of administration, introduces hierarchy and an advanced concept of administration. The charter also limits the administration's rights, strengthens their terminology, and introduces additional obligations.

The system of penalties is based on the rules and regulations of the specified server. It introduces consequences for offenses, including violations even for the basic rules of the project (violation of the rights of any participant, or bypassing them). This document must also be edited when editing parent documents. Administrative force is higher than the rules and the charter, but lower than the "Constitution".

## Chapter III: Documentation Flow.

When changing the rules of the server or the charter of the administration, the points of the punishment system change accordingly, the same applies in the opposite direction. This item works for the reviewers (if certain conditions are met), developers and managers of this server.

When changing the basic rules of the server (or "Constitution"), accordingly, it is necessary to edit the rules on all kinds of servers, statutes and punishment systems, the same does not work in the opposite direction. This item works for developers (at full level), checking (when certain conditions are met and only at the server level), and managers of this server (only at the server level).

Also, the legal clauses of the rules, the charter and the punishment system are editable only by the developers (as well as the basic rules of the project), and the administration as a whole does not have the right and ability to edit the legal departments. They can only be edited directly by the developers or with a direct written order from the developers.

The main rules of the project have a global and higher concept in the administrative sense, then there is a system of punishments, which, although higher than the rules and regulations of the server in the hierarchy of documents, is necessarily based on the current project documentation and cannot be separated in its administrative sense.
