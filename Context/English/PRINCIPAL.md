# Documentation principle.

## Chapter I: Documentation Basis.

* To understand further reasoning, you need to read each piece of documentation, each inference is based on past data from the documents.

* It is also recommended to keep the control rules in individual original format on each server while reasoning is based on the legal format of the project.

## Chapter II: Documentary Judgment.

* The principle of the logical work of the documentation is simple: in the general plan of the project, as well as when discussing the basis for the founding of the rules, the charter, the system of violations or the discussion of initial rights, the supreme documents are the "Basic Rules of the Project" (hereinafter - the Constitution), the Constitution answers the initial legal questions and allows them to direct and limit in a certain order, but She is not responsible for what will happen for her violations, therefore the system of punishments also depends on the Constitution. This means that the Constitution is the original and universal document for all servers, which is immutable and constant in the order of the general project.

**Conclusion:** "Basic rules of the project", or the Constitution - is the original legal document and establishes the rules with a system of punishment. The Constitution answers the initial legal questions, but does not answer their violations.

* The Constitution answers the initial questions, also explains what each position can do and its general rights, but It does not answer the questions of the offense, and also what the project user cannot do. The rules are also based on the Constitution, as stated in the first chapter (see "Legal Section") of the server rules, where the player's rights or individual administrator rights are separately allocated. In what follows, it is said that the user cannot do and other restrictions. This document already expands not only the general legal part, but also the restrictive one, and also complements the administration in the rights and complements the concept of the administrator as a whole.

**Conclusion:** Server rules introduce initial restrictions and complement the notions of administrator, explaining unsaid things in the Constitution. The rules also introduce the first bans and restrictions on any user.

* The Constitution and the Rules introduced and supplemented the concepts of an administrator, respectively, but although in general terms the administrator is limited in rights, he still does not have detailed legal and restrictive instructions. This is corrected with the help of the Charter, which introduces full control over the hierarchy of the administration, improves the concept of the rights of the administration and governors from the Constitution. It also introduces a division of the composition of administrations.

**Conclusion:** The Charter restricts the administration and at the same time introduces a detailed instructional system that regulates internal and external relations. He also introduces additional legal assessments based on the Constitution.

* The Constitution, the Rules and the Charter are combined into one eco-system, but they do not explain the consequences for any type of offense, this is done by a document that embodies the system of punishments, where any offense and subsequent punishment are spelled out.

**Conclusion:** The system of punishments is based on all three previous documents, and answers the legal question for punishment for offenses on the project.

## Chapter III: Documentation sequence.

* The Constitution is the original document and guarantees the universal rights of players and administrators, as well as issues the initial legal instructions for communication between servers and within the server itself.

* The rules set initial restrictions on players and add the ability to local restrictions and local player rights, as well as complement the definition of the administration.

* The Charter establishes advanced legal restrictions on the administration, broadens its horizons and concepts, and establishes an internal hierarchy.

* The document of the system of violations establishes universal punishments, as the fact of the consequences of violations for any type of previous documents, it is inseparably connected with them and is based only on their system.

**Overall result:** The Constitution is the guarantor of rights and the supreme document, the Charter and the Rules on the server are based on it, which indicate the first restrictions. As a result, this entire eco-system is consecutively pointed to the document of the system of violations, which indicates the consequences of violating the rules of this eco-system.
