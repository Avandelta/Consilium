## About us

Our project wants to improve the quality of all Russian-language servers (projects) for Minecraft. We want to show users what high-quality game assemblies are, adequate rules that are not divorced from reality or context, and the administration can also be adequate or understanding. We offer a product from players for players: a cozy atmosphere, a system of autonomous servers, pleasant gameplay and democratic rules.
